	abstract = {We present Waken, an application-independent system that recognizes UI components and activities from screen captured videos, without any prior knowledge of that application. Waken can identify the cursors, icons, menus, and tooltips that an application contains, and when those items are used. Waken uses frame differencing to identify occurrences of behaviors that are common across graphical user interfaces. Candidate templates are built, and then other occurrences of those templates are identified using a multi-phase algorithm. An evaluation demonstrates that the system can successfully reconstruct many aspects of a UI without any prior application-dependant knowledge. To showcase the design opportunities that are introduced by having this additional meta-data, we present the Waken Video Player, which allows users to directly interact with UI components that are displayed in the video.},

Accessibility APIs provide some information about the size and location of targets. How-ever this information is incomplete because it does not sup-port all targets found in modern interfaces and the reported sizes can be inaccurate. These accessibility APIs access the size and location of targets through low-level hooks to the operating system or an application. We have developed an alternative solution for target identification that leverages visual affordances in the interface, and the visual cues produced as users interact with targets. We have used our novel target identification technique in a hybrid solution that combines machine learning, computer vision, and accessibility API data to find the size and location of targets users select with 89\% accuracy. Our hybrid approach is superior to the performance of the accessibility API alone: in our dataset of 1355 targets covering 8 popular applications, only 74\% of the targets were correctly identified by the API alone.},

Unfortunately, staying in sync with a video while trying to use the target application at the same time requires users to repeatedly switch from the application to the video to pause or scrub backwards to replay missed steps. We present Pause-and-Play, a system that helps users work along with existing video tutorials. Pause-and-Play detects important events in the video and links them with corresponding events in the target application as the user tries to replicate the depicted procedure. This linking allows our system to automatically pause and play the video to stay in sync with the user. Pause-and-Play also supports convenient video navigation controls that are accessible from within the target application and allow the user to easily replay portions of the video without switching focus out of the application. Finally, since our system uses computer vision to detect events in existing videos and leverages application scripting APIs to obtain real time usage traces, our approach is largely independent of the specific target application and does not require access or modifications to application source code. We have implemented Pause-and-Play for two target applications, Google SketchUp and Adobe Photoshop, and we report on a user study that shows our system improves the user experience of working with video tutorials.},

When browsing videos with more frames than pixels in the slider, aside from some frames being inaccessible, scrolling actions cause sudden jumps in a video's continuity as well as video frames to flash by too fast for one to assess the content. We propose a content-aware dynamic timeline control that is designed to overcome these limitations. Our timeline control decouples video speed and playback speed, and leverages video content analysis to allow salient shots to be presented at an intelligible speed. Our control also takes advantage of previous work on elastic sliders, which allows us to produce an accurate navigation control.},

Sikuli allows users to take a screenshot of a GUI element (such as a toolbar button, icon, or dialog box) and query a help system using the screenshot instead of the element's name. Sikuli also provides a visual scripting API for automating GUI interactions, using screenshot patterns to direct mouse and keyboard events. We report a web-based user study showing that searching by screenshot is easy to learn and faster to specify than keywords. We also demonstrate several automation tasks suitable for visual scripting, such as map navigation and bus tracking, and show how visual scripting can improve interactive help systems previously proposed in the literature.},
