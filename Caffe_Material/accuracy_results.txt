Here's the dictionary of accuracy results for the no noise stuff. It's pretty much what I expected.

{260: 0.832, 140: 0.769, 400: 0.91, 20: 0.346, 280: 0.924, 160: 0.785, 420: 0.928, 40: 0.539, 300:
0.895, 180: 0.812, 440: 0.925, 60: 0.466, 320: 0.912, 200: 0.835, 460: 0.952, 80: 0.521, 340: 0.895,
220: 0.855, 480: 0.936, 100: 0.543, 360: 0.922, 240: 0.847, 500: 0.936, 120: 0.594, 380: 0.934}

For the noisy stuff, it's a bit weirder

{260: 0.834, 140: 0.621, 400: 0.586, 20: 0.477, 280: 0.724, 160: 0.756, 420: 0.716, 40: 0.698, 300:
0.733, 180: 0.721, 440: 0.748, 60: 0.726, 320: 0.84, 200: 0.781, 460: 0.899, 80: 0.765, 340: 0.892,
220: 0.864, 480: 0.851, 100: 0.689, 360: 0.866, 240: 0.656, 500: 0.743, 120: 0.596, 380: 0.79}

In fact, these results will steadily decline down to .25 later
