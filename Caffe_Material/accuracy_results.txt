Here's the dictionary of accuracy results for the no noise stuff. It's pretty much what I expected.

{260: 0.832, 140: 0.769, 400: 0.91, 20: 0.346, 280: 0.924, 160: 0.785, 420: 0.928, 40: 0.539, 300:
0.895, 180: 0.812, 440: 0.925, 60: 0.466, 320: 0.912, 200: 0.835, 460: 0.952, 80: 0.521, 340: 0.895,
220: 0.855, 480: 0.936, 100: 0.543, 360: 0.922, 240: 0.847, 500: 0.936, 120: 0.594, 380: 0.934}
